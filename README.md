## Configure and deploy an Identity Provider to provide OIDC

Deploy OIDC endpoint's with Identity Provider. Examples of Identity Providers are Auth0, Keycloak, etc.<br>
For instance, with Auth0, you can create an application that provides an OIDC endpoint according to the following documentation.<br>
https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/applications/application-settings

The main URL paths used by the tool to link to IdPs are as follows. Please configure appropriately when creating OIDC endpoints.

* Path to redirect after OIDC authentication
    * ``http(s)://[your-hostname-and-port]/callback``
* Path to redirect after logout
    * ``http(s)://[your-hostname-and-port]/``

## Install Package

# Configure according to IdP specifications.
OIDC_AUTHORIZATION_URL="https://${OIDC_IDP_DOMAIN}/authorize"
OIDC_TOKEN_URL="https://${OIDC_IDP_DOMAIN}/oauth/token"

OIDC_SCOPES="openid,email,profile"

# Set the credential information previously set up in the IdP.
OIDC_CLIENT_ID="abcdefgh12345678..."
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="ABCDEFGH12345678..."

# Set the URL of this Web server.
SERVER_URL="https://your-relying-party.com"

# At least 64 characters are required.
SECRET_KEY="99l5RkdZqr9YEhyywWA8cZy5E0UfyYDm6B9tllnvw1ARU8TKI61JvIA6yKmJRwHzgdLfZwLK"

COOKIE_NAME="oidc-cookie"

# Query string key name used to store the URL the user was trying to access before being redirected to the login page.
